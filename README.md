# 📚 PDF Chunker: PDF to Text Converter for Large PDFs

## 🔍 Overview
The **PDF Chunker** app is designed to help you extract and chunk large PDF files into smaller, manageable pieces. Whether you're working with lengthy books, reports, or other large documents, this tool enables you to break them into smaller text chunks that are easier to process, especially for Large Language Models (LLMs) and platforms like **NotebookLM**.

This app helps you strip text from PDFs, reduce their size, and split them into smaller sections to feed into models for better performance and manageability.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **📑 PDF text extraction**: Easily extract text content from any PDF file.
- **🔪 Chunking**: Split large PDFs into smaller text files, each containing up to 400,000 words. Ideal for processing large documents in parts.
- **⚙️ Customizable chunk size**: Adjust the number of words per chunk to suit your needs.
- **📥 Downloadable text chunks**: Get individual text files for each chunk, ready for use in various applications, including feeding into **NotebookLM** or other LLM platforms.

## 💡 Use Cases
- **⚖️ Reduce PDF size for LLMs**: Large PDFs can be too big to feed directly into language models. Use this app to split PDFs into smaller, more manageable parts.
- **📜 Strip text from PDFs**: Extract pure text from PDFs without the hassle of complex formatting or images.
- **📚 Prepare books for AI models**: Break down full-length books, manuals, or academic papers into smaller segments that can be ingested by machine learning models.
- **📈 Feed into NotebookLM**: Split large documents to match the size constraints of **NotebookLM** or similar platforms.

## 🔄 How It Works
1. **⬆️ Upload your PDF**: Drag and drop a PDF file into the app.
2. **📝 Extract the text**: The app will extract the text from the PDF.
3. **⚙️ Customize the chunk size**: Adjust the maximum number of words per chunk (default: 400,000 words).
4. **📥 Download the chunks**: The app will split the PDF text into smaller files and provide you with download links for each chunk.
